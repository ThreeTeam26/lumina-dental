Financial dashboard logic.

Every figure is derived from real records — never hard-coded:
  • Revenue  = paid extra charges on non-cancelled bookings (attributed to the
               booking's date). This is the clinic's billing mechanism.
  • Pending  = extra charges that are entered but not yet marked paid.
  • Expenses = rows in the `expenses` table.
  • Net profit = revenue − expenses.
