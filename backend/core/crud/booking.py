    cancelled and leaves a gap. `patients_ahead` (a separate, active-only

    request commits first wins that number, the loser recomputes the next
    number (now reflecting the winner's row) and retries.

    `estimate_fn(patients_ahead) -> (start, end)` is recomputed on every
    attempt so the stored estimate always matches the queue number that
