"""
Clinic working-days / working-hours configuration.

This is the backend source of truth for the doctor's default schedule — it
mirrors the values previously hard-coded in the frontend (`CLINIC.hours` /
`layout.tsx` JSON-LD) so the queue system, availability checks and the
"mark as entered" business rule all read from one place.

Individual branches can override this with their own working days/hours
(`Branch.working_hours`, set via Clinic Settings) — every function below
takes an optional `schedule` table; pass one built with
`branch_working_hours()` to check a specific branch instead of the default.

To change the clinic-wide default, edit WORKING_HOURS below (or wire this up
to a database-backed settings table later — the rest of the app only talks
to the helper functions in this module, not the raw dict).
